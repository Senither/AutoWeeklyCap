# Auto Weekly Cap

Auto Weekly Cap is a plugin for Dalamud that will use [Lifestream](https://github.com/NightmareXIV/Lifestream) and [AutoDuty](https://github.com/erdelf/AutoDuty) to switch between your characters and cap the weekly tomestones automatically.

## Installation

> **Note:** The plugin is currently in development, so to use the plugin you'll need to build it manually, in the future you'll be able to use the steps below to install the plugin officially.

To use Auto Weekly Cap you'll need to add the plugin repository to Dalamud by following the steps below:

* Open Dalamud's settings (`/xlsettings`)
* Click on the Experimental tab
* Scroll Down to Custom Plugin Repositories
* Add the following URL: https://dalamud-plugins.senither.com/authors/senither.json, then click on the Plus next to it
* Click on the Save icon in the bottom right corner

Once you've added the repository to Dalamud, you can now install the plugin by searching for "Auto Weekly Cap" or "Senither" in the Dalamud plugin list.

## How to use

Once you've installed the plugin, you can configure it by opening the Dalamud plugins list, finding the plugin and clicking on the settings button, alternatively you can open the settings by typing `/awc` in the chat.
From there you can select the AFK time you want to use, and the plugin will automatically enable multi mode after the selected time has passed.

> **Note:** The plugin will only work if both [Lifestream](https://github.com/NightmareXIV/Lifestream) and [AutoDuty](https://github.com/erdelf/AutoDuty) are installed and enabled.
